"Holiday Inn Express & Suites Timmins, an IHG Hotel",Brandon C,3,"Stayed for one night for business, overall the stay was ok but definitely some issues that would make me reconsider staying here again:
Good:
- Spacious rooms
- Large bathrooms (I think I had an accessibility bathroom)
- Bathroom was clean
- Staff here were all very nice
- Has a pool so good for kids
Not so good:
- Window curtains couldn't pull all the way shut and I had a light right outside my window on the street which made it hard to sleep.
- Cleanliness of the room was pretty questionable. There was a weird stain on the bench, and what looked like a dried bloody hand print on one of the beds.
- My colleagues both had issues with their rooms - one of them didn't have a functioning cable box and the other had tape covering their thermostat so they couldn't change the temperature.
- Gym was pretty dirty/doesn't look like the upkeep is that great there.",-0.699999988079071,3.5999999046325684

"Holiday Inn Express & Suites Timmins, an IHG Hotel",Dan Laffin (Dan Laffin),5,I dont know why this is considered a 2 star place... its amazing. First off the staff is so friendly Ally checked us in today and after about an hour she calls the room to see if everything is OK. You know a place stands behind the expectations when they call to check in.  She was super polite and very professional. The breakfast is always good the rooms always clean. I've stayed here 3 times and enjoyed it each time. But Ally I think her name was Ally... she absolutely went above and beyond and was super helpful üëè üëå  highly recommend this hotel!,0.800000011920929,5.699999809265137

It's a great place to travel with a pet, with plenty of grassy areas surrounding the hotel. Housekeeping staff should check the TV.

Holiday Inn Motel,Marcos MC,5,"We had to show up late around 11:30pm and the staff inside were very nice and quick to provide my family 2 rooms. We took rooms 8 and 5, both we're clean and overall very quite. They also had different layouts surprisingly, which was kind of nice to see.

Not even an hour in this room and we were itching from everywhere. We were told that it was the last room available but when the owner was confronted, he suddenly had other rooms to offer.

Breakfast services (buffet style) was well done with loads of options and plenty of sitting.

Disappointed we weren't able to enjoy the pool / hot tube area. It's quite small and there were plenty of kids running all over the place (lobby, hallways and elevators). We did warn the front staff twice before we had to take action in our own hands.

Well before I arrive my CC informs me I have been charged for the room. I haven‚Äôt even checked in yet. I arrive and the front desk person says that I have to put a $100 deposit down that I get it returned to me in 4-7 days - Ridiculous really. I can understand $25-50 but not $100. I am assigned a room in a section of of the hotel - Regent I believe - the place is a maze - don‚Äôt lose your room card sleeve. My room is nice and clean, however, when I took a shower; the shower is set up in an awkward way: you have to step into the shower to turn it on and you immediately get sprayed by the first temperature that comes out - Freezing Cold and then you have to go back in and deal with it in order to get the temp you prefer. Once this is accomplished - you enter with your full body. See photo and good luck with that - lol.

"Holiday Inn Express & Suites North Bay, an IHG Hotel",FELIX SAJI,5,"I had an absolutely fantastic experience at Holiday Inn that I'll cherish forever. The occasion was a bachelor party for one of our dear brothers in Christ, and every aspect of our stay exceeded expectations. The ambiance and service provided by Holiday Inn truly made it a night to remember.

From the moment we arrived, the staff at Holiday Inn ensured our comfort and satisfaction. The room was extra ordinary and well arranged, creating a welcoming and relaxed atmosphere. It was evident that the hotel prioritizes attention to detail.

The highlight of our stay was undoubtedly the pool time. The pool facilities were clean, well-maintained. It added an extra layer of enjoyment to our celebration, and the memories we made there will forever be etched in our minds.

As we gathered in the evening, the hotel continued to impress with its accommodating service. The staff went above and beyond to make sure our needs were met, creating a seamless and enjoyable experience for the entire group. It truly felt like they understood the importance of the occasion and played a crucial role in making it a special night.

I am genuinely grateful to Holiday Inn for their exceptional service and commitment to creating a memorable experience. The combination of a comfortable stay, delightful pool time, and outstanding service makes me wholeheartedly appreciate the effort put forth by the Holiday Inn team.

"Holiday Inn Express & Suites Huntsville - Muskoka, an IHG Hotel",Tonya Cowle,5,"We were greeted by Richard which was a lovely first impression of the hotel. He was able to check us in early, gave us a laugh & recommendations of things to do in the area. We were there to skate at Arrowhead Provincial Park (5 min away), we also went downtown for dinner (also 5 min away)

Our room was exactly what we were expecting. 2 queen beds, standard room with coffee station, desk and shower tub in bathroom. The room was clean, however there was ice cream left in the freezer and a sweater in the drawer from previous guests (no big deal, we didn't complain). After an active day the beds were just what we needed for a good night sleep and I always LOVE Holiday Inn pillows (I wish I could take them home)! The hotel seemed busy but was quiet on our floor.

There were 4-5 trucks that were parked in multiple spots in the small parking lot (one with a trailer that wasn't supposed to be there) as well as others parked in two spots. As the parking lot is small that was frustrating to try and find a spot & wish the staff could call them and ask them to park within the designated lines.

Breakfast was the standard hot & cold food. My daughter wishes there was more variety for bagels (just plain was available). The breakfast nook is very tiny so it was busy but the staff were doing a great job keeping everything stocked.

The pool is small but was perfect for our kids to have some fun before bed. The staff were stocking towels consistently.

Check-in process took 15 minutes because they were training a new (senior) employee who has zero computer knowledge. Room keys didn't work. They blamed me for demagnetizimg the keys in my top shirt pocket???

Don't blame the paying customer for your obvious incompetence.

The room was stinky and old dirty carpet. Furniture was from the 80s. The bathroom was dirty (photos enclosed). My dog wouldnt eat what they called human food.

We have never stayed in such an unmaintned hotel room before. Cloth curtain was torn and stained in many spots. Forget about bathroom privacy, not only did the door not lock but the door wouldn't remain closed as our video shows whileBathroom light switch also didn't work at times.

Cleanliness of the room was somewhat normal considering cleaning staff are held on tight schedules of usually 45min or less (though it would be nice to have a clean toilet bowl).

The pool was great, not cold like other hotel pools I‚Äôve been to. It even had a warmer kiddie pool that was great for my 8 month old.

One of my only complaints was the room is a little run down. The bathroom was very nice, but as you can see from the photos, there were scratches on the wall and closet door. The blankets on the bed were thin and had holes in them. We did not have a window to the outside. Our window faced the pool and play place. This was bad because we couldn‚Äôt get any natural light without people seeing inside our room‚Ä¶ it wasn‚Äôt very private. The room looked bigger in the photos they have on their website, but the beds were comfortable.

My other complaint is no free breakfast. I probably could‚Äôve looked past the other shortcomings of this place if they offered a free continental breakfast.

"Holiday Inn & Suites Winnipeg-Downtown, an IHG Hotel",Lotus Chong,2,"Everything in this building is super dated. Needs a renovation big time. The 2 elevators are slow, finicky, and generally don‚Äôt feel safe and steady. They have a pretty late check-in time of 3pm, and one of our two rooms were not ready. The two rooms on the third floor are also inconsistent. Prices and room choices were exactly the same, but one room had carpet and the other had hardwood floors, as well one had a microwave and the other didn‚Äôt. In the carpeted room, it looked like there was questionable substances caked into the carpet, and the rooms itself was not very clean.

I could also hear the shower turning on in the room beside mine.

Beware that the surrounding area is quite sketchy. I felt unsafe walking outside.

Their only saving graces are that the front desk staff are friendly & helpful, their beds are decently comfy, and they change towels daily.

So I booked two nights. The room was ok. One of the bed sheet had a blood stain on it. We changed the sheet but it was not pleasant to begin with. Shower head was terrible but hot water was running, thank goodness. The ac worked. The breakfast was alright. No potatoes or yogurt. The only good thing about the breakfast was pancakes. The front desk service was alright but maybe not average. No smile or customer service. Straight to the business. There was a fire alarm test that they didn't tell us. My kids got scared because the alarm went off randomly and I had to go to the front desk to find out and my wife was taking a bath. They said they will come anytime within an hour without any consideration of their guests. I asked them to call us before they come in but nope. They will come in to check the alarm... What kind of customer service is that? I didn't argue with them but it really showed their level of customer service.

It has been over a year since my last stay here, I was excited to return just because of the restaurant used real scrambled eggs. To my disappointment, that is no longer the case. It is not often to find a hotel that uses real products instead of instant heat and serve foods. I would not mind paying a few extra dollars per night for better quality food, and I'm sure others would agree.
The staff is always friendly, and the rooms are clean, beds are comfortable. Granted, there are some updates and renovations that could be done. I was shocked to see a dryer from the 1980's in the guest laundry room.

Positives: tablecloths been replaced nightly, room has been vacuumed. Drawbacks: Water provided by Hotel in large glass dispenser is not cleaned properly as I and my coworker got black chuncks of what I assume is mold with our water. Dispenser was replaced when I brought it to desk staffs attention and offered a bottled water. My co-worker was not and it was not chaneged out (It is a running joke with Instructors that it is ""Mold Water""). Where I was greeted cheerily by the Sales Coordinator when we met in the bathroom before my review and brought to her attention the lack of toilet paper, second time we met in bathroom (after review, where my picture and name is included) she looked me dead in the eye and didn't greet me or smile. Salad prices went up by $2 and as I sit here writing this on April 17th at 10:30am all the fresh food expiration dates are for April 16th. I'm honest and to the point on my reviews. I have work Customer Service/Retail/Hospitality jobs for 20 years plus. I understand the challenges, but feel there is room for improvement and disappointed in my treatment after writing this review. Hope they can do better in the future.

At this location for 3 weeks (2nd week at time of this review) for job training. Training room was not cleaned daily or weekly. Tablecloths became very dirty. Bathrooms in lobby were Not cleaned daily. Toilet paper supplies empty in several stalls even after bringing this to the attention of Hotel staff. Be prepared to pay $4 to $12 for food in Market. $4 for water, $7 for 20oz. Pop, $10 for salad, $12 wrap. I took advantage of the buffet one time, $13.77 for dry over cooked food. Was not my best experience with Hotel Buffet. Drury Inn has better Buffet in my opinion, which is included in your stay.

The staff at this location were exceptionally amazing, especially during the busy breakfast hours. There was one gentleman who greeted everyone with a ""good morning"" (I wish I had gotten his name to recognize him), which added a wholesome touch many hotels lack.

Some key amenities that stood out:

1. The hallways are brightly lit.
2. The exterior of the hotel is also well-lit, more than most places I've seen, which makes you feel very safe.
3. The hotel lobby is clean and inviting.
4. Coffee and tea are readily available at any time in the lobby, offering a full experience.
5. The included breakfast was fantastic for the family, removing the need to think about where to go.
6. The pools and exercise rooms are clean and well-maintained.
7. The rooms are very clean and brightly lit.
8. The AC unit was amazing!

Opportunities:

1. The coffee machines in the rooms were not maintained; the dispenser inside the machine was disappointingly dirty.
2. I had to pick up my own towels at the front desk, which was unusual for me. I‚Äôm not sure if this is the standard at this location, but it was different.

"Holiday Inn Fargo, an IHG Hotel",Keesha Mason,1,"Poor Hotel Quality and Handling Issues: I had to stay for one night. I picked this hotel because of its reviews, and it said it had a functional gym. I was sadly disappointed- I should have stayed at a 2-star hotel.

1. At my check-in, I asked if the gym was working because I was training for a long endurance bike ride and I needed to work out. The front desk girl gave me a room by the gym, but I had to move my car to a different door to check in (there was a snowstorm this day). After parking my car, I went to the door only to find out there was a written service note saying ""this door is not working properly. Please go to another door."" I then had to get back into my car and go to another door and walk. I called the front desk to tell her. She said, ""Oh my bad, I guess no one told me.""

2. THERE WAS NO HOT WATER for two days of my stay. I called the front desk to tell them, and they told me that the pipes are cold and sometimes it happens with their rooms. TOOK A NICE COLD Shower for two days straight.

3.I went to the gym that night to find out the treadmill and bike were not working at all. There was dust and cobwebs everywhere. I asked the front desk if they could fix the treadmill. They said yes. The next day it was still broken.

4. As I checked out, I told the woman about my cold water. She said, ""Oh, I am sorry for that experience that has happened at our hotel at times,"" and said ""I could see if we can give you 10% off.""
I declined and said, ""It is okay, that is not needed. I wanted her to know to get it fixed, but can I get a coffee?"" She said, ""We have a coffee shop, and you will need to pay."" I said to her, ""Wait, you will take 10% off my room, but I can't get a cup of warm coffee for cold water for 2 days?""

THE ONLY REDEEMING quality is that the coffee shop girl gave me coffee!  She knows what it means to have great hospitality.

When room was ‚Äúcleaned‚Äù. They gave us only two towels again!  Still no soap.  The bathtub and surround were old, & Dirty and in need of repair  Wallpaper around toilet and tub was peeling .  Hair left on the floor

Went to have breakfast at the buffet. Three containers of old looking food. We walked away and went off site

Rooms very stuffy. Hot even when the air conditioning came on.  Zero way to get fresh air into the room.  Especially needed since Covid is still persistent

Overall. Staff very nice
But it‚Äôs a old dirty building that's poorly maintained

Note:  if you have to park in the back or sides of the building, those entrances lock at 10 pm despite needing a key fob to get in.  They did not notify us of this and had to walk around the front with arms full of items for the celebration of life late at night   Neighborhood is suspect too

Also no sewing items in the building nor at their ‚Äústore‚Äù. Needed a safety pin.  They couldn‚Äôt help me

"Holiday Inn & Suites Ottawa Kanata, an IHG Hotel",Laila H,5,"Great hotel rooms, that have been updated. We got the King corner suite with connecting 2 queen bed room for the kids. King room was spacious and the new updated washroom is very nice. Walk in shower is huge!
Would totally recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Ottawa area, as it's a very good location.",0.699999988079071,3.9000000953674316
"Holiday Inn & Suites Ottawa Kanata, an IHG Hotel",Praveen Banavar,4,"Review:

I recently stayed at this hotel and overall, it was a mixed experience. The rooms are definitely spacious, which was a plus. However, it was disappointing to find that water bottles had to be purchased separately, with none provided in the room. The gym was small and only catered to cardio enthusiasts, which might not suit everyone's workout preferences. The pool was decent, but nothing extraordinary.

One standout feature was the room service, especially with the use of robots, which added a unique touch. The inclusion of a microwave in the room was convenient for quick meals.

On the downside, the breakfast options were extremely basic and lacked variety, with no consideration for vegetarians or vegans. Additionally, room service was only available upon request, which could be inconvenient for some guests.

However, the staff were consistently polite and accommodating, which contributed positively to the overall experience. As for the location, it was conveniently situated within walking distance of the city center, Walmart, and various dining options.

In summary, while the hotel has its strengths such as spacious rooms and friendly staff, there are areas for improvement, particularly regarding amenities and dining options.",0.0,7.400000095367432
"Holiday Inn & Suites Ottawa Kanata, an IHG Hotel",Amber B,5,"We loved our room here at the Kanata Holiday Inn! The king size suite had a separate bedroom from the living area. We really appreciated the space and the table on wheels in the kitchenette. We were able to roll the table to the sofa to use for our dinner.
The hotel and room were very clean and quiet. We have already booked our next stay here in March.",0.5,3.5999999046325684
"Holiday Inn & Suites Ottawa Kanata, an IHG Hotel",Michel Robichaud,5,"The hotel is freshly renovated, close to many services and restaurants which is useful since, at the tire of this writing (May 2024) the restaurant is closed. They do offer 10-15% rebates on some restaurants around the premises.

Overall very good experience, friendly staff and nice and clean rooms.",0.30000001192092896,1.100000023841858
"Holiday Inn & Suites Ottawa Kanata, an IHG Hotel",MARCULATION,2,"Was pretty put off in the morning when housekeeping tried to come in without knocking. Luckily I had the deadbolt on.
My girlfriend was in the shower - I don't understand why someone would just barge into someone's room who hasn't checked out yet? I find that incredibly disrespectful and awful thing to do - you pay for a private room just to have it violated like that - it's not like the rooms are cheap either.

When I approached the housekeeping afterwards, they tried telling me that front desk had told them I checked out. Then, when i asked the front desk about it, they told me they had done no such thing. Nor did they seem bothered about it. Don't think I'd stay here again - rude, disrespectful staff.

Place was clean at least.",-0.4000000059604645,5.300000190734863
"Holiday Inn & Suites Mississauga West - Meadowvale, an IHG Hotel",Dan Power,3,"This doesn't appear to be an ""old"" hotel but it seemed a little well worn and dated in many ways. The room decor was a little odd and I don't think it's something I normally notice much. Wall paper or paneling made me think of a padded cell. Beds were comfortable and decent quality bedding. Breakfast an additional $16. So used to getting a 'free' breakfast I was surprised at that. No additional parking fee however. Front desk staff were efficient and courteous. The area doesn't have any food options that I could find in a quick drive around i.e. no coffee shops, fast food type places. But they do have a few snacks and things available by the front desk. I have mixed feelings about this hotel. Booked last minute and It was slightly cheaper than others in the area but not sure that makes it a good value. Not bad I suppose but I think I'd look for another option next time.",-0.10000000149011612,5.300000190734863
"Holiday Inn & Suites Mississauga West - Meadowvale, an IHG Hotel",Tammy DM,3,"Bathroom was very dirty but when I sent pictures to them, they cleaned it better.

I would still never use the jetted tubs...  they were filthy.
Breakfast should be included as it has less variety and comparable quality than a HI express.  Not really worth the $16+tax.

After seeing my bathroom, I elected to avoid the pool and hot tub.

The staff all are eager to please and really great!  Particularly in the restaurant!

Convenient location.",0.0,5.199999809265137
"Holiday Inn & Suites Mississauga West - Meadowvale, an IHG Hotel",Patrick Chandonia,2,Booked by my office probably to save money. Bed is very comfortable. Bathroom is nice and large but everything else seems old. But my biggest issue is that I can‚Äôt cast on the tv so I‚Äôm stuck watching my show on my phone‚Ä¶ That was understandable 10 years ago but today‚Ä¶.

"Holiday Inn & Suites Mississauga West - Meadowvale, an IHG Hotel",Matthieu Poole,4,"The room was surprisingly more than was expected considering the price of the room and was pretty comfortable; even for 7 people. Photos will have to wait until next time as my kids exploded in the room as soon as I opened the door.

The hotel restaurant/bar looked really nice and the smell definitely made me want to go try some of the food.

The gym needs work but the Pool and hot tub was nice. It was a little bit small if there's more than one family with kids but it's almost never busy.

Service was friendly and professional. They also support government, military and first responders with a discount. I marked it down for my experience because I was charged for my room before they added the discount and then refused to give it to me because the payment was processed. I won't argue semantics but this was not pleasant

This place being close to the highway and an abundance of restaurants is really nice too.

The other downfall is the smoking area is right next to the door and it was not pleasant unloading my vehicle or bringing my children passed a bunch of people smoking weed just to get in the hotel.

*Heads up* for those who come here, it's a sharp turn into the hotel from the street and can come quick if not careful.",0.0,8.0
"Holiday Inn & Suites Mississauga West - Meadowvale, an IHG Hotel",Imran Husain,1,"Very mediocre stay here. I typically don‚Äôt complain about too much, but this was such an abysmal stay I felt forced to place a poor review.
My family and I stayed here for a few days to attend a wedding. So many issues with this place that we‚Äôre not even being addressed.
First, the air conditioning in our room was not functional. We called them several times each day. They would send somebody up, who would then proceed to say they ‚Äúfixed it.‚Äù But it remained obsolete each time. They brought us a fan which may have been enough to marginally get by while sleeping at night. But we were sweating during the daytime.
Secondly, lighting was a problem and was just too dim to adequately get ready. Also, several of the outlets were non functioning as well.
Thirdly, the ‚Äúfitness center‚Äù was just laughable. Just some random dumbbells, not even in pairs, and run down equipment.
Only positive was the location and size of the room we stayed.
If you‚Äôre looking to stay in the are, I highly recommend to stay away from this hotel.",-0.6000000238418579,10.5
